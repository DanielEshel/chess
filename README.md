# chess
chess game i made, this is the client code. there was a server running but it is currently closed so chess.exe wont work anymore.

to run the code you need to run the main_server code on a local computer and then run main_client on 2 different clients in the local network. make sure to change the ip adress of the server on server_ip_address.txt to the correct one :D.

chess_objects.py and chess_utilities.py 
have all of logic of the chess game itself (like moves, checkmate chescks, stalemate and stuff like that so you can use it for whatever.
